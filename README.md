# Welcome to the Official Website of GDSC PESU! âœ¨

## Important Rules and Points about this website.
1. The Shared-Components folder will have the common componnets such as the navbar, footer, etc as each route may use them
2. For route specific components, make/ use existing folder by name <b>ROUTE_NAME-Components</b> and build components
3. For development tidiness, maintain the following rules:
    - By default as components are Server Components, you have to explicitly mention "use client" for client side components.
    - Start with the imports from packages/ libraries 
    - Import the helper functions/ constants/ etc.
    - Finally Import other Components if needed.
